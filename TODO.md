# Things to do

1) Figure out how to save/retrieve secret/confidential files
  - HPE cert, other non-public stuff

2) Get the HPE certificate so I can simplify the way I login to HPE sites.
  - save confidential files to <secret store>
  - figure out how to export/import it on my machine(s)
  - do this ^

3) List of PRs I need to create against the "mackup" project
   - istat-menus-4

4) Add to mackup
  - Pulse?

5) Setup Tunnelblick for FTC VPN (at least)
  - save confidential files to <secret store>

6) Figure out where to save dotfiles?
  - inside my fork of pretzo?
  - inside a dotfiles repo?
  - Examples: ???  (.tm_properties, .mackup.cfg, .gitconfig already handled)

7) Add note about getting a new DigitalBadge to simplify logon to HPE web properties:
- Use FireFox
- https://mydigitalbadge.hpe.com
https://myitsupport.ext.hpe.com/myITsupport/ITSService?categorySelected=DigitalBadge

8) Scripts/bin folder
  - ~/bin is now there, but
